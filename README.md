# Introduction

This repository contains the R code and the associated data files that were used to execute the entire workflow for the following project, which is now a published manuscript (cited in APA format):

Lauer, D. A., Lawing, A. M., Short, R. A., Manthi, F. K., MÃ¼ller, J., Head, J. J., & McGuire, J. L. (2023). Disruption of trait-environment relationships in African megafauna occurred in the middle Pleistocene. _Nature Communications_, _14_(1), 4016.

# Usage Instructions

By running the "code_for_project.R" file, a user can reproduce all of the analytical outputs and figures that are included in the published manuscript.

To run the code file, first download the file and the "data_files" folder. Ensure that both the file and folder are in the same directory, because the folder contains the data files that the code processes and analyses. Then, download and install the [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) integrated development environment for R. Check out the [RStudio User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/) for more information on how to use it. Then, open RStudio, and use it to install the following R packages (note that many of these packages may have more updated versions at this point):

* animation (version 2.6)
* colorspace (version 2.0.2)
* cowplot (version 1.0.0)
* e1071 (version 1.7.9)
* fields (version 10.0)
* geometry (version 0.4.2)
* ggplot2 (version 3.3.5)
* grDevices (version 3.6.1)
* grid (version 3.6.1)
* gridExtra (version 2.3)
* Hmisc (version 4.3.0)
* iNEXT (version 2.0.20)
* phytools (version 0.7.47)
* plot3D (version 1.1.1)
* plyr (version 1.8.6)
* raster (version 3.4.5)
* readxl (version 1.3.1)
* rgdal (version 1.5.23)
* rgeos (version 0.5.5)
* segmented (version 1.1.0)
* sp (version 1.4.5)
* stringr (version 1.4.0)
* tibble (version 3.1.6)

With the packages installed, open the code file in RStudio and run the code. Note that the code was written using R version 3.6.1.
